# password-generator-# Module 5 Challenge: Password Generator
Overview

This application allows you to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected. The app runs in the browser, featuring dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It provides a clean and polished user interface that is responsive to multiple screen sizes.

## Application Functionality

The password generator allows users to:
- Present prompts for password criteria, including:
  - Generate a password when the button is clicked
  - Length of password (at least 8 characters but no more than 128)
  - Character types (Lowercase, Uppercase, Numeric, Special characters)
- Validate each input, ensuring at least one character type is selected
- Display the generated password in an alert or write it to the page

## Password Special Characters

The password may include special characters. For reference, you can check the [list of Password Special Characters from the OWASP Foundation](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).

 The application does not produce any errors in the console when you inspect it using Chrome DevTools.
